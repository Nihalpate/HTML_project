            Summary: 
        </h3>
        <p>
            During my time as a Data Analyst at Himalaya Chemicals, I played a vital role in improving the company's decision-making process by defining data requirements and optimizing data handling using MySQL. I performed complex analysis using SQL queries, compiling and interpreting sales data, and presenting performance reports to the management. My expertise in statistical analysis and data visualization tools such as Tableau allowed me to develop comprehensive reports with graphical representation, covering MPU, UC, Net Production, and Net Row Material (consumption/wastage). Additionally, I led a project on optimizing plant and equipment utilization, collaborating with various departments to execute Queuing Theory based on Continuous Time Markov Processes Model using Python and NumPy library. My contributions helped the management with crucial data and suggestions, leading to a significant 2% increase in ROI. Overall, my commitment to delivering accurate and meaningful analysis, as well as my strong problem-solving skills, consistently contributed to the success of the organization.
